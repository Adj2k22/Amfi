<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The project 
Creating a NFT for clothes. We need to be tracking the data of the life cycle of a clothing item. This includes the manufacturing, designing, owners, transferring between owners, recycling but also where the wool came from. But also information like what did what designer/manufacture create from the clothing item. The NTF also needs to have multiple contracts on legal basis between the different designers and manufactures, the clothing item needs to feel like a collab between the parties. And when an item gets reselled all the parties on the chain get paid, like royalty’s but with clothes. 

The NFT 
First the token has to be minted. We have to do research on how to do that and where we want to set up the NFT’s. It has to have cheap gas fees. Some questions we have research: At what point is the NFT minted, What does the process look like, Who will use/need the NFT, How can we create a legal contract between different people. 

The approach 
Our team will be working for the research division for the AMFI. Our group needs to feel like a small start-up company that has been hired by the AMFI. Research needs to be part of the end product.
